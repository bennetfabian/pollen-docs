# Introducing Pollen

Pollen is a standards-driven alternative to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). It's a micro-library of [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--\*) that encourage consistency, maintainability, and rapid development. Use it from prototype to production, as a utility-first foundation for your own design system.

### What it looks like

Pollen's low-level variables can be used to build any design. They work anywhere and don't require a buildstep or class naming conventions. They're easy to extend and globally responsive, without introducing preprocessors or new syntax.
